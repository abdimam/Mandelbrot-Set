# Mandelbrot-Set
I implemented the Mandelbrot set using the Newton-Raphson method to generate a fractal plot. By leveraging NumPy's vectorization, I achieved efficient computation and good resolution. The plot visualizes convergence to polynomial roots with distinct colors, showcasing both numerical methods and Python's scientific computing capabilities.
